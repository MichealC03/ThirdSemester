# This was my hash table project which can be seen in the .java files
# This project took each word out of a text file and sorted them into a bucket based on the words ASCII value
# The ASCII value modded by the number of buckets determined which bucket the word went in to
# After every word was sorted, there was then a search function to find if the word entered was in a bucket or not
