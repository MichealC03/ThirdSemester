# This is my linked list project
# First the program gets a random set of nums then inserts them in order
# Next the front and back are removed
# A size is then outputted
# The user is then asked to examine an element to see if empty
# A new smaller list is then created then merged with the first
# This folder contains two classes and an output txt file
